        <li>The Services allow you to access the full content of your emails, which includes additional categories of
            personal information, however these categories are accessed directly via the Services on your device from
            the email server of your email service provider (e.g., outlook.com) and not collected, used, or disclosed by
            UETMail.

    <h4>Your Rights Under CCPA</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Right to Know.</b> You have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect,
            use, disclose, and sell. To make a request, contact UETMail via email at <a
                    href="mailto:thebigroyal@gmail.com">thebigroyal@gmail.com</a>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Deletion Rights.</b> You have the right to request deletion of your personal information. See the section
            above titled “Your Choices to Manage Information” for options and processes for deleting your personal
            information. Deletion requests require a two-step process, first by making the request, then a second
            confirmation either via a response from your email account or a second confirmation inside the Services.
        </li>
        <li><b>Verification.</b> UETMail verifies requests made via email by first sending a confirmation email to the
            account connected with the Services, verification is completed when you reply to that email confirming the
            request. If a request is made on your device from within the Services, then the request for data is
            confirmed via a pop-up in the Services.
        </li>
        <li><b>Response Time.</b> UETMail responds promptly to all requests, but will confirm receipt of requests within
            10 days, and respond within 45 days from the day you made the request. If additional response time is
            necessary, up to 45 days, UETMail will provide you notice and explanation.
        </li>
        <li><b>Who may make a request.</b> Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that
            you authorize to act on your behalf as your agent, may make a request related to your personal information.
        </li>
        <li><b>Denials.</b> If we are unable to verify the request, the request is unlawful, or exceeds your rights
            under the CCPA, we will deny the request.
        </li>
        <li><b>Non-Discrimination.</b> You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by UETMail for the
            exercise of your privacy rights under the CCPA.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/><br/>
    <h4>Deidentified Information</h4>
    <p>UETMail sells Commercial Data that is deidentified information to its UETMail Trends subscribers. This is not the
        same as selling personal information and it is important that you understand the difference.</p>
    <p>Under the CCPA, personal information does not include deidentified information (Cal Civ Code §
        1798.140(0)(3))</p>
    <p>To be deidentified, information “cannot reasonably identify, relate to, describe, be capable of being associated
        with, or be linked, directly or indirectly, to a particular consumer” (Cal Civ Code § 1798.140 (h)).</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <h4>
        Further, to use deidentified data, UETMail is required to:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Have implemented technical safeguards that prohibit reidentification of the consumer to whom the information
            may pertain.
        </li>
        <li>Have implemented business processes that specifically prohibit reidentification of the information.</li>
        <li>Have implemented business processes to prevent inadvertent release of deidentified information.</li>
        <li>Make no attempt to reidentify the information. (Cal Civ Code § 1798.140 (h))</li>
    </ol>
    <p>UETMail meets or exceeds these deidentification requirements. As a technical safeguard, we deidentify Commercial
        Messages to create Commercial Data by obfuscating usernames and email addresses, reducing the fidelity of
        physical addresses, and the use of filters and algorithms to identify personal information and remove it from
        the Commercial Data we provide to our subscribers, making reidentification unreasonable. UETMail’s business
        processes prohibit reidentification of personal information in the Commercial Data sold to our subscribers and
        include security controls to safeguard against breaches of both personal information and the deidentified
        information in Commercial Data. UETMail does not attempt to reidentify personal information contained in the
        Commercial Data sold to our subscribers, nor allows our subscribers to.</p>

    <p>Where you have consented to data processing, your consent provides the legal basis to process your personal
        information, such as when you consent to processing in relation to the processing of your data for Trends or for
        the Services. You have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Please note that your withdrawal of consent to
        collect and process your personal information will not affect the lawfulness of processing your personal
        information based on your consent before you withdraw your consent.</p>
    <p>We may also process your personal information on the basis of contractual necessity to perform a contract we have
        with you. For example, we process the messages in your email accounts when you link them to your UETMail account
        in order to provide you with the UETMail Services.</p>
    <p>We may also process your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests, including analytic
        reporting and improving the Services. For example, UETMail has a legitimate interest in collecting information
        about your device hardware and operating system to better understand how users access and use the UETMail
        Services. We also have a legitimate interest in providing and developing improved AI algorithms to deliver
        better product features to our users.</p>
    <p>In some cases, UETMail may process personal information pursuant to legal obligations or to protect your vital
        interests or those of another person.</p>

    </p>
    <p><b>Right to Restrict or Oppose: </b>Where we rely on legitimate interests to process your personal information,
        you have the right to object to such processing by using the contact information below. Please note that some
        processing is essential to providing the UETMail service.</p>
    <p><b>Right to Access Correct and Rectify: </b>UETMail account holders may access, correct and rectify their

    <p><b>Revoking Consent: </b> For the purposes of EU data protection legislation, the "data controller" of your
        personal information is UETMail. UETMail has appointed, Hetal Pandya, to be its representative. You can contact
        them directly regarding the processing of your personal information by UETMail by email at <a

    <p><b>Privacy Shield</b></p>
    <p>UETMail complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set
        forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information
        transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. UETMail has certified to the
        Department
        of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this
        privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more
        about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit
		<a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov.">http://www.privacyshield.gov.</a></p>
    <p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, UETMail commits to resolve complaints about our collection or
        use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy
        Shield policy should first contact UETMail at the contact address below. If you have an unresolved privacy or
        data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute
        resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The Privacy Shield Principles describe UETMail’s accountability for personal information that it subsequently
        transfers to a third party agent. Under the Principles, UETMail shall remain liable if third party agents
        process
        the personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless UETMail proves it is not
        responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
    <p>The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over UETMail’s compliance with the Privacy Shield. </p>
    <p>As a last resort and under limited circumstances, EU individuals with residual privacy complaints not resolved
        pursuant to the foregoing mechanisms may invoke a binding arbitration option before the Privacy Shield Panel.
